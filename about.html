				<p>In my free time I also enjoy travelling! From places in Europe to Asia, I have visited many countries
					and
					want to continue to explore more.
					When I am travelling I enjoy trying new foods and exploring the local natural treasures - I love all
					the
					national parks!</p>
				<p>Speaking of national parks, I have visted about a dozen of the US national parks, a couple in Canada
					and
					couple in New Zealand.
					They have all been so unique and fun to explore. I am hoping to one day see all the US national
					parks!
